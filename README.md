# To readers

Please read this document before you clone the git.

## Environment

If you are prefer doing your work on ubuntu, I prepared a one-key setup bash file named "ubuntu_config.sh"

## Prepare

Cmake and NetCDF should be prepared, "fabm_gotm_install_1.sh" would help you.

## Building

"fabm_gotm_install_2.sh" includes clone and setup configurations for gotm, fabm and cases of gotm.

## At last

I wroted these is for saving your time rather than teaching you.

**PLEASE** learn the basic knowledge about linux, cmake, makefile and make notes afterward.
